# Applied-Econometrics

## Course Summary
Applied Econometrics is a course that focuses on the practical application of statistical and econometric techniques to analyze economic data and test economic theories. It is designed to provide students with the necessary tools and skills to conduct empirical research in economics and make informed policy decisions. Here is a summary of the main topics covered in an Applied Econometrics course:

### Part One:
* Chapter 1 introduces econometrics and stresses the importance of providing quantitative answers to quantitative questions. It discusses the concept of causality in statistical studies and surveys and the different types of data encountered in econometrics.

* Material from probability and statistics will be reviewed in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively.

### Part Two: 
* Chapter 4 introduces regression with a single regressor and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, and Chapter 5 discusses hypothesis tests and confidence intervals in the regression model with a single regressor.
* In Chapter 6, we will learn how to address omitted variable bias using multiple regression, thereby estimating the effect of one independent variable while holding other independent variables constant. Chapter 7 covers hypothesis tests, including F-tests, and confidence intervals in multiple regression.
* In Chapter 8, the linear regression model is extended to models with nonlinear population regression functions, with a focus on regression functions that are linear in the parameters (so that the parameters can be estimated by OLS).
* In Chapter 9, students step back and learn how to identify the strengths and limitations of regression studies, seeing in the process how to apply the concepts of internal and external validity.
### Part Three:
This part presents extensions of regression methods. You will develop your Career Skills. For students to succeed in a rapidly changing job market, they should be aware of their career options and how to go about developing a variety of skills. Data analysis is an increasingly marketable skill. This text prepares the students for a range of data analytic applications, including causal inference and prediction. It also introduces the students to the core concepts of prediction using large data sets.

* In Chapter 10, we learn how to use panel data to control for unobserved variables that are constant over time.
Panel Data Analysis: Panel data sets contain observations on multiple individuals or entities over time, allowing for the analysis of both individual and time effects. Students learn about fixed effects and random effects models, and how to account for unobserved heterogeneity and dynamic panel data issues.
* Chapter 11 covers regression with a binary dependent variable.
Limited Dependent Variable Models: Many economic phenomena involve outcomes that are limited or discrete, such as binary choices (e.g., yes or no) or counts. Students learn about econometric models suitable for analyzing such data, including logit and probit models for binary outcomes, and Poisson and negative binomial models for count data.
* Chapter 12 shows how instrumental variables regression can be used to address a variety of problems that produce correlation between the error term and the regressor, and examines how one might find and evaluate valid instruments.
Instrumental Variable (IV) Analysis: IV analysis is used when there is endogeneity, i.e., a correlation between the independent variable(s) and the error term in a regression model. Students learn about the identification conditions for IV estimation, two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, and techniques for testing the validity of instruments.
* Chapter 13 introduces students to the analysis of data from experiments and quasi-, or natural, experiments, topics often referred to as “program evaluation.”
Causal Inference and Program Evaluation: This section covers methods for estimating causal effects in observational data, where randomized controlled experiments may not be feasible or ethical. Students learn about difference-in-differences (DID) estimators, regression discontinuity Estimators, and instrumental variable approaches to address endogeneity and selection bias.
* Chapter 14 turns to econometric issues that arise with large data sets(AKA Big Data), and focuses on prediction when there are very many predictors.

Throughout the course, students are required to apply the econometric techniques learned to real-world datasets and complete empirical research projects. You will gain hands-on experience in data analysis using Python via Jupyter Notebook, and learn how to interpret and communicate their findings effectively.
